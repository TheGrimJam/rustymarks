# A (hopefully) more performant markov chain generator than python

An implemntation of this in python on an old project was always prohibitively slow with users waiting 50-60 seconds for especially large corpuses, so giving it a spin in rust while learning the language seemed a good start ( and maybe link it in as a static binary/command line tool )

Missing... a lot of important functionality.
